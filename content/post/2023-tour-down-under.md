World Tour road cycling returns to Australia for the first time since 2020 with the six stage (including prologue) Tour Down Under. It’s probably proper journalism to mention the race’s title sponsor; however, Australian gas giant Santos is being targeted by the climate action group [Extinction Rebellion](https://www.news.com.au/sport/cycling/extinction-rebellion-protesters-to-disrupt-major-cycling-race/news-story/cab90686d6fe8916efcedda88ad6b79a) with a series of [disruptive protests](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-01-15/extinction-rebellion-protestors-arrested-at-tour-down-under/101857126) including the arrests of three women, ages 69, 70, and 74 for public nudity so there’s no telling how long the sponsorship will hold (the group pressured Santos to abandon it’s deal with the Australian Open in 2021 and has similar plans for TdU).

This is also a good time to familiarize oneself with the plethora of transfers between teams and new sponsors. Cycling is the only sport I follow where athletes tend to only get 1-2 year contracts and sponsors change just as frequently. Imagine if the Pittsburgh Penguins moved and became the Bank of Guelph for no reason other than some rich guy decided Southern Ontario needed a Stanley Cup.

## Preview

The Tour Down Under is known for its hot days and narrow GC margins (in the past ten races, the race has been won by an Australian seven times, all under 48” to 2nd). It’s a showcase for Australian talent and the picturesque southern coast (think Koala bears, bunches of hopping kangaroos, rolling hills of vineyards) and a welcome mental retreat from the late January drudgery of winter training in the Northern Hemisphere.

### Favorites

#### Sprinters
**Caleb Ewen** - after spending a portion of the European winter in Australia to train, he’s set to ride TdU followed by the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race and the UAE Tour to prepare for Milan—San Remo. His Schwalbe Classic criterium win on Saturday will give him a confidence boost going into the season.

**Kaden Groves** - fellow Australian finished third in the Schwalbe Classic.

#### General Classicification
**Jai Hindley** - Giro winner and Aussie fast uphill finisher

**Ethan Hayter** - fabulous reduced-sprint finisher which is what many stages in TdU end up being. Good prologue as well.

**Michael Matthew** - great reduced-sprint capabilities and can prologue too

**Rohan Dennis** - hasn’t raced yet in 2023 but could easily win the prologue and sit behind his Jumbo team for a few stages

### Prologue - Tuesday 17th January
Super short (*5.5km city loop on road bikes*) technical parade through Adelaide. Expect **Rohan Dennis**, **Ethan Hayter**, or other TT specialists to have small advantages over the pure sprinters like **Kaden Groves**.

### Stage 1 - Wednesday 18th January
Five times up Menglers Hill (*4km, 3.7%*) separates the sprinters from their shot at a win. **Michael Matthews** and his Jayco team will try to dislodge the pure sprinters from the train. **Caleb Ewan** survived the hilly Australian National Championship in fine form and **Ethan Hayter** is a good climber as well so the trio could have a shot from a reduced bunch.

### Stage 2 - Thursday 19th January
Another reduced bunch sprint day with a decisive steep (*2km, 7.8%*) climb 22km from the line. Expect Ewan and Matthews to make the finale. [More.](https://tourdownunder.com.au/race/mens/stages/mens-stage-2)

### Stage 3 - Friday 20th January
This could be the Queen stage with Corkscrew Road (*2.4km, 8.9%*) appearing just before a short 6km descent to the finish. Corkscrew ramps up to over 15% in the middle so can provide a launching point for a GC attack. **Daryl Impey** won from a 20-man group in 2019, Simon Gerrans from a 10-man group in 2016, and in 2014 Cadel Evans stayed away to win solo. Bonus seconds on the line could be the difference in the overall. [More.](https://tourdownunder.com.au/race/mens/stages/mens-stage-3)

### Stage 4 - Saturday 21st January
Proper sprint day for the big boys. The finish is a little uphill but expect the powerhouses like **Phil Bauhaus** and **Kayden Groves** to have a shake at their first victory of 2023. [More.](https://tourdownunder.com.au/race/mens/stages/mens-stage-4)

### Stage 5 - Sunday 22nd January
The race ends with five times up Mount Lofty (*1.5km, 6.5%*) with the final time finishing on the peak. Pure climbers should have a go at it but the climb isn’t quite long or steep enough to free the punchers from a chance at the win and possibly GC. [More.](https://tourdownunder.com.au/race/mens/stages/mens-stage-5)

## Prediction

What’s exciting about the Tour Down Under is that as the first race of the season anyone can win. Form is finicky coming out of the holidays and lots of guys haven’t spent much time down under before racing in the heat. **Luke Plapp (+800)** won the Australian National Championships but it’s unclear if he’ll get the nod for INEOS over **Ethan Hayter (+375)** who with **Michael Matthews (+350)** are the odds-makers favorites for the tour. Matthews needs to survive the prologue in a top spot and earn bonus seconds along the way in two of the three sprint days to have a chance up Mount Lofty. I think it’s more likely a climber has a bunch finish down Corkscrew and ends up trouncing the field up Lofty—think **Jay Vine (+3400)**, **Simon Yates (+1900)** or Aussie longshots like **Simon Clarke (+12600)** or **Jai Hindley (+15100)**. No matter the finish it’s always fun to see a GC between big guys like Matthews and little guys like Yates.
